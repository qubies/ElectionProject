# CMPUT 656 Election Act Parser

Some code snippets come from documentation (e.g. loading from tensorflow-hub or spacy).
Most of the code is custom written for the project. 

The code should be relatively easy to run, as there are few dependencies, but I do not have a public docker container for it.
All code output is in the notebooks for the project. 

The notebook `replication book` will guide the use of the classes and functions, while the notebook `running` has a more complete guide of how the code was used to produce the results in the report.
The output in replication book was reproduced after the original reporting was complete.


Requirements used in the image for the project are in `requirements.txt`, based off a docker, tensorflow-gpu image. If desired, install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
