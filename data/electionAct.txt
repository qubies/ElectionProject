(2)  If the Court, on application by the Election Commissioner under subsection (1), is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed or is likely to commit an act or omission that is contrary to this Act, and that the nature and seriousness of the act or omission, the need to ensure fairness of the electoral process and the public interest justify the issuing of an injunction, the Court may issue an injunction ordering any person named in the application to do one or both of the following:

                                 (a)    refrain from committing any act that appears to the Court to be contrary to this Act;
